      <center><h1>Intro</h1></center>
      <center><p>At Restoration Academy, we believe that every child in the Birmingham area deserves an excellent, Christ-centered education. Our mission is to provide this opportunity through advancing the two greatest commandments in the life of every student: to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love others as ourselves.
        We work individually with students from remedial to accelerated and offer free in-school and after-school tutoring, teach foreign language, and provide opportunities for art. We also require the study of US and world history, all sciences, language, literature, government, finance, physical education, the arts, Bible, and apologetics.
        Restoration Academy is accredited with AdvancED, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the Alabama Independent School Association (AISA) and the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI).

      <center><h1>Our Story</h1></center>
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">Restoration Academy was started in 1988 by Dr. Anthony Gordon. He founded the school in response to divisive forces such as crime and violence that had ensnared many of the young people at his church and in his community. He followed God's calling to provide a quality, private education to predominantly lower-income families. He believed that such an education should be available to more than affluent families.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">To this day, the school has stayed committed to Dr. Gordon's vision by making a quality and Christ-centered education available to children in grades K5 - 12. In 1999 the school relocated to the Fairfield community and is now a vital and integral part of the Western area of town.
      Restoration Academy is committed to do its best to meet individual students at their point of need, provide dynamic instruction and curriculum, competitive sports, and outlets for kids to grow into all the potential God desires. Our most celebrated outcome is seeing students overcome the potentially destructive lifestyles of fatherlessness, functional illiteracy, addiction, abuse, and incarceration. Our prayer is that upon graduation of Restoration, each student has a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and is committed to following Him.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 40px">We have an active volunteer program, with over 70 weekly tutors in addition to over 100 classroom sponsors, "room moms", and other various volunteers. On the Stanford Achievement Test our students in grades 7 to 12, on average, are advancing two years in one year's time in reading comprehension and math. We are proud that for the past seven years, all of our graduates have been accepted into college, many with full scholarships.
      Most importantly, we are breaking generational cycles of poverty, violence, addiction and fatherlessness in Fairfield and the greater Birmingham area.
