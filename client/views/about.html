                                soul, mind, and strength, and to love others as ourselves. We work individually with students
                                from remedial to accelerated and offer free in-school and after-school tutoring, teach foreign
                                language, and provide opportunities for art. We also require the study of US and world history,

            </center>
            <p class="normalFont" style="text-indent: 40px">Restoration Academy was started in 1988 by Dr. Anthony Gordon. He founded the school in response to divisive
                forces such as crime and violence that had ensnared many of the young people at his church and in his community.
                He followed God's calling to provide a quality, private education to predominantly lower-income families.
                He believed that such an education should be available to more than affluent families.</p>

            <p class="normalFont" style="text-indent: 40px">To this day, the school has stayed committed to Dr. Gordon's vision by making a quality and Christ-centered education
                available to children in grades K5 - 12. In 1999 the school relocated to the Fairfield community and is now
                a vital and integral part of the Western area of town. Restoration Academy is committed to do its best to
                meet individual students at their point of need, provide dynamic instruction and curriculum, competitive
                sports, and outlets for kids to grow into all the potential God desires. Our most celebrated outcome is seeing
                students overcome the potentially destructive lifestyles of fatherlessness, functional illiteracy, addiction,
                abuse, and incarceration. Our prayer is that upon graduation of Restoration, each student has a personal
                relationship with Jesus Christ and is committed to following Him.</p>

            <p class="normalFont" style="text-indent: 40px">We have an active volunteer program, with over 70 weekly tutors in addition to over 100 classroom sponsors, "room
                moms", and other various volunteers. On the Stanford Achievement Test our students in grades 7 to 12, on
                average, are advancing two years in one year's time in reading comprehension and math. We are proud that
                for the past seven years, all of our graduates have been accepted into college, many with full scholarships.
                Most importantly, we are breaking generational cycles of poverty, violence, addiction and fatherlessness
                in Fairfield and the greater Birmingham area.
